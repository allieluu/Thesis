abstract = {Random forest (RF) analysis of genetic data does not require specification of the mode of inheritance, and provides measures of variable importance that incorporate interaction effects. In this paper we describe RF-based approaches for assessment of gene and haplotype importance, and apply these approaches to a subset of the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium case-control data provided by Genetic Analysis Workshop 16. The RF analyses of 37 genes identified many of the same genes as logistic regression, but also suggested importance of certain single-nucleotide polymorphism and genes that were not ranked highly by logistic regression. A new permutation method did not reveal strong evidence of gene-gene interaction effects in these data. Although RFs are a promising approach for genetic data analysis, extensions beyond simple single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses and modifications to improve computational feasibility are needed.},
annote = {Background
- previously proposed model-based methods exacerbate multiple-testing problems, are computationally intensive, and are too simple for diseases that involve more than 2-way interactions
- Random forests are good for picking out interesting genes/SNPs, not so much for determining statistical significance

Methods
- analyze 17 candidate genes (PADI4, PTPN22, ITGAV, STAT4, IL1B, CTLA4, IL13, LTA, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, VEGFA, TNF, IL6, C5, TRAF1, MS4A1) + 20 null genes not suspected to be related to RA (pick 20 others at random?)
- exclude SNPs with low call rates
- 245 SNPs in 37 genes w/ RA case/control as the outcome
- use default tuning parameter m{\_}try = sqrt(p) where p is the total number of predictor variables (245)
- 5000 tree forest

- Assessing gene importance based on SNP VI measures: "ranked genes according to 1) the maximum SNP VI over all SNPs in a gene, or 2) the mean SNP VI for a gene. Further, we implemented a RF analysis of haplotype effects, similar to that proposed by Non- yane and Foulkes"
- Assessing the impact of genetic variations as predictors of RA and modifiers as effects of other genes: fit RF to original data, get measure of VI of each SNP of each gene, permute genotypes, recalcultate},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Machine learning methods and in particular random forests (RFs) are a promising alternative to standard single SNP analyses in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). RFs provide variable importance measures (VIMs) to rank SNPs according to their predictive power. However, in contrast to the established genome-wide significance threshold, no clear criteria exist to determine how many SNPs should be selected for downstream analyses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose a new variable selection approach, recurrent relative variable importance measure (r2VIM). Importance values are calculated relative to an observed minimal importance score for several runs of RF and only SNPs with large relative VIMs in all of the runs are selected as important. Evaluations on simulated GWAS data show that the new method controls the number of false-positives under the null hypothesis. Under a simple alternative hypothesis with several independent main effects it is only slightly less powerful than logistic regression. In an experimental GWAS data set, the same strong signal is identified while the approach selects none of the SNPs in an underpowered GWAS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The novel variable selection method r2VIM is a promising extension to standard RF for objectively selecting relevant SNPs in GWAS while controlling the number of false-positive results.},

abstract = {Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is an unexplained and common spinal deformity seen in otherwise healthy children. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood despite intensive investigation. Although genetic underpinnings are clear, replicated susceptibility loci that could provide insight into etiology have not been forthcoming. To address these issues, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ∼327 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 419 AIS families. We found strongest evidence of association with chromosome 3p26.3 SNPs in the proximity of the CHL1 gene (P {\textless} 8 × 10(-8) for rs1400180). We genotyped additional chromosome 3p26.3 SNPs and tested replication in two follow-up case-control cohorts, obtaining strongest results when all three cohorts were combined (rs10510181 odds ratio = 1.49, 95{\%} confidence interval = 1.29-1.73, P = 2.58 × 10(-8)), but these were not confirmed in a separate GWAS. CHL1 is of interest, as it encodes an axon guidance protein related to Robo3. Mutations in the Robo3 protein cause horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS), a rare disease marked by severe scoliosis. Other top associations in our GWAS were with SNPs in the DSCAM gene encoding an axon guidance protein in the same structural class with Chl1 and Robo3. We additionally found AIS associations with loci in CNTNAP2, supporting a previous study linking this gene with AIS. Cntnap2 is also of functional interest, as it interacts directly with L1 and Robo class proteins and participates in axon pathfinding. Our results suggest the relevance of axon guidance pathways in AIS susceptibility, although these findings require further study, particularly given the apparent genetic heterogeneity in this disease.},

abstract = {Variable selection in genome-wide association studies can be a daunting task and statistically challenging because there are more variables than subjects. We propose an approach that uses principal-component analysis (PCA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify gene-gene interaction in genome-wide association studies. A PCA was used to first reduce the dimension of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within each gene. The interaction of the gene PCA scores were placed into LASSO to determine whether any gene-gene signals exist. We have extended the PCA-LASSO approach using the bootstrap to estimate the standard errors and confidence intervals of the LASSO coefficient estimates. This method was compared to placing the raw SNP values into the LASSO and the logistic model with individual gene-gene interaction. We demonstrated these methods with the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 rheumatoid arthritis genome-wide association study data and our results identified a few gene-gene signals. Based on our results, the PCA-LASSO method shows promise in identifying gene-gene interactions, and, at this time we suggest using it with other conventional approaches, such as generalized linear models, to narrow down genetic signals.},

abstract = {Recently, genome-wide association studies have substantially expanded our knowledge about genetic variants that influence the susceptibility to complex diseases. Although standard statistical tests for each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) separately are able to capture main genetic effects, different approaches are necessary to identify SNPs that influence disease risk jointly or in complex interactions. Experimental and simulated genome-wide SNP data provided by the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 afforded an opportunity to analyze the applicability and benefit of several machine learning methods. Penalized regression, ensemble methods, and network analyses resulted in several new findings while known and simulated genetic risk variants were also identified. In conclusion, machine learning approaches are promising complements to standard single-and multi-SNP analysis methods for understanding the overall genetic architecture of complex human diseases. However, because they are not optimized for genome-wide SNP data, improved implementations and new variable selection procedures are required. Genet. Epidemiol. 33 (Suppl. 1):S51–S57, 2009.},

abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selection and identification are the most important tasks in Genome-wide association data analysis. The problem is difficult because genome-wide association data is very high dimensional and a large portion of SNPs in the data is irrelevant to the disease. Advanced machine learning methods have been successfully used in Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identification of genetic variants that have relatively big effects in some common, complex diseases. Among them, the most successful one is Random Forests (RF). Despite of performing well in terms of prediction accuracy in some data sets with moderate size, RF still suffers from working in GWAS for selecting informative SNPs and building accurate prediction models. In this paper, we propose to use a new two-stage quality-based sampling method in random forests, named ts-RF, for SNP subspace selection for GWAS. The method first applies p-value assessment to find a cut-off point that separates informative and irrelevant SNPs in two groups. The informative SNPs group is further divided into two sub-groups: highly informative and weak informative SNPs. When sampling the SNP subspace for building trees for the forest, only those SNPs from the two sub-groups are taken into account. The feature subspaces always contain highly informative SNPs when used to split a node at a tree.},

This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary GWAS statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides??a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single GWAS study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact. Pathway analysis of GWAS results is used to prioritize genes and pathways within a biological context.

abstract = {Several incidence and prevalence studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been reported during the last decades, suggesting a considerable variation of the disease occurrence among different populations. The majority of studies curried out in Northern European and North American areas estimate a prevalence of 0.5-1{\%}, and a mean annual incidence of 0.02-0.05{\%}. The occurrence of the disease seems to be lower in other parts of the world. Some studies from North American, North European, and Japanese populations suggest a decline in both the prevalence and incidence of the disease after the 1960s. RA is related to an increased mortality, and the expected survival of RA patients is likely to decrease 3-10 years. There is epidemiological evidence that genetic factors are related to an increased risk of RA. However, RA is considered to be a multifactorial disease, resulting from the interaction of both genetic and environmental factors, which contribute to its occurrence and expression. The main risk factors for the disease include genetic susceptibility, sex and age, smoking, infectious agents, hormonal, dietary, socioeconomic, and ethnic factors. Most of these factors are likely to be associated with both disease occurrence and severity. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
